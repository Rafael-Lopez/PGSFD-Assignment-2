# PGFSD-Assignment-2
Learner's Academy Online Management System

The system keeps track of classes, subjects, students, and teachers. It has a back-office application with a single administrator login.
The administrator can:

- Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes
- Set up a master list of all the teachers
- Set up a master list of all the classes
- Assign classes for subjects from the master list
- Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
- Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)
 
There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class, such as the list of students, subjects, and teachers.
